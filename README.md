# GGCloudCert_Capstone_Project
Analyze and activate the data with Looker Enterprise  
--- 
This is the Capstone Project from Google Cloud Certificate where I use Looker Studio to capture data of:  
1) Total Amount of Oustanding Loans
2) Percentage of Oustanding Loans
3) Total Count of Oustanding Loans
4) Top 10 Customer by Highest Income

Throughout the project, I have learned how to use Looker Studio to interact with the database, build visualization, and gaining insights to satisfy business need.  

This project is an introduction for me to get involve in to Google Cloud Platform, more specifically the Looker Studio.
